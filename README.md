# Covid Detection using ANN methods

This repository contains code for detecting covid using ANN methods. 

This project was created as part of the coursework for module 7088CEM Artificial Neural Networks for [Coventry University](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/course-structure/pg/eec/data-science-and-computational-intelligence-msc/). Any use of the code needs to be cited appropriately. 

## Usage

The code can be executed in google colab - <https://colab.research.google.com/>

Make sure you upload the dataset files and specify the path for the same in the code. 

Code Example:
```
# Setting train and test directories
train_dir='/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/ANN/xray_dataset_covid19/train'
test_dir='/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/ANN/xray_dataset_covid19/test'
```

## Data

The dataset used as a part of this project contains X-RAY images of patients having symptoms of covid like pneumonia and others who don't have covid. 

This dataset is available at - <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets>

 If the above link is not accessible then you can find all the images under the xray_dataset_covid19 folder.

## Techniques used

As a part of this experiment, I have used two methods.

 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
 2. Xception Model
