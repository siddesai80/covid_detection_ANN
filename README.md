# Covid Detection using ANN methods

This repository contains code of detecting covid using ANN methods. 

This project was created as part of coursework for module 7088CEM Artificial Neural Networks for Coventry University. Any use of the code needs to be cited appropriately. 

## Usage

The code can be executed in google colab - <https://colab.research.google.com/>

Make sure you upload the dataset files and speicfy the path for the same in the code. 

Code Example:
```
# Setting train and test directories
train_dir='/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/ANN/xray_dataset_covid19/train'
test_dir='/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/ANN/xray_dataset_covid19/test'
```

## Data

The dataset used as a part of this project contains X-RAY images and are available under dataset folder.
